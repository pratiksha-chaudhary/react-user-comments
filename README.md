# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Reason being it helps setup development environment quickly which you can always customize later on. `npm run eject` would help with that. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` : Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test` : Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run build` : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
